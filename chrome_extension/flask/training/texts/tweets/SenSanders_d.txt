While Americans are dying because they can't afford Mylan's egregious drug prices, the companys CEO got a 671% raise to over $18 million.

Mars, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and North American Meat Institute support the anti-GMO bill. Consumers aren't the priority here.

Sen. Roberts' GMO bill imposes no penalties whatsoever for violating the labeling requirement, making the law essentially meaningless.
The GMO legislation in Congress would create a confusing, misleading and unenforceable national standard for labeling GMOs. It cannot pass.
Big agriculture companies like Monsanto do not believe people have a right to know what's in the food they eat.

The heart of any real campaign finance reform must be a limit on spending - an end to the money chase.
How can politicians talk about morality and family values, when we turn our backs on the millions of children and families in poverty?

Its baffling that even with overwhelming scientific consensus, leaders of this country still deny the existence of climate change.
The question of our time is whether we will take on the enormous power of the billionaire class, or do we slide into political oligarchy.
Huge, profitable corporations regularly get massive government subsidies. We have socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.
What seems radical today will seem mainstream tomorrow if we stand together.
Strong unions are the reason why America once led the world in wages in benefits. We must rebuild the trade union movement in this country.

To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. 78% of Americans agree.
The solution to Puerto Ricos debt crisis is not more austerity.  The solution is more economic development.
We should want more people voting, not less. If we believe that, then it's high time we established automatic voter registration nationally.
Frankly, much of our economic and trade policy is a disgrace, designed to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the average worker.
The current political campaign finance system is corrupt and amounts to legalized bribery.
The most revolting part of the student loan crisis is that the federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year.

Too many Americans in this country have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use.
Our nation has always been a refuge for the oppressed. We must unite families not tear them apart. The deportation raids must end.
People spend millions on campaigns because they have an agenda. And the billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American people.
My advice for climate change deniers in Congress: Worry less about you campaign contributions and more about your children.
Its absurd that we have more people in jail than any other nation, including China, a Communist authoritarian country four times our size.
We live in the richest nation in the history of the world but we cant even provide the most elementary human needs to millions of people.

We must stop letting multinational fossil fuels corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense. https://t.co/eF4gl0h5xz
While the middle class is disappearing, the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally and corporations are making at record-breaking profits.
No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to our nations economic well-being.
We cannot fix our criminal justice system if corporations are allowed to profit from mass incarceration.
Tragically, in America today we have more people in jail than any other country in the world.
A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance of ending up in jail. That is unacceptable.
The U.S. must join the nations that understand the benefits of having an educated workforce that isnt burdened with enormous student debt.

If the Walton family can receive billions in taxpayer subsidies, maybe it's OK for working people to get health care and paid family leave.
The solution to Puerto Ricos debt crisis is not more austerity. The solution is more economic development, more jobs, and less poverty.
The Democratic Party must stand on the side of working people and low-income people, not Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry.
Privatizing the VA would be a huge mistake and a great disservice to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.
The U.S. can lead the world in reversing climate change by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy.
Despite Americans being some of the most productive workers in the world, wages haven't kept up with inflation since 1968. This must change.
What poverty in America is tragically about is that we have millions of people who are dying at ages much, much younger than they should.
If it's radical to think that the United States shouldn't have more people in jail than any other country, then yes, count me as a radical.
Mexico isn't going to pay for Donald Trump's wall, and Puerto Rico will not pay for this outrageous and undemocratic control board.

Pleased to see Vermont stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and pass drug price transparency legislation led by @RepCP.
Today, 40 million Americans are drowning in more than $1.3 trillion in student loan debt. We must make public colleges tuition free.
The threat of climate change is a pivotal moment in history that we must address by transitioning  aggressively to a clean energy system.
We need new trade policies to prevent corporations from throwing American workers out on the street and running to China for cheap labor.

Directors at the Federal Reserve should not be hand-picked by bankers from the same banks that the Fed is in charge of regulating.
If we do not address the planetary crisis of climate change, we will be judged by future generations and by history in a very negative way.

What we have got to do is to redefine who we can be as a nation. What rights we are entitled to as humans. That's the struggle.
Health care is a right, not a privilege. Everyone in America should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income.

The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It is not a conservative issue. It is an American issue.
I think the issue of income and wealth inequality is in fact a moral issue. It is an issue that we must confront here and across the world.
Fewer people voting and and the wealthy contributing huge amounts of money-- this is the kind of democracy the ruling class likes.
When workers don't have to worry about how they are going to pay rent, they become better workers. Raising the minimum wage is common sense.
No parent should have to send their sick child to school because they can't take a day from work. We need paid family leave in America.
The fact is there's been class warfare for the last thirty years, but it's been the ruling class taking on the middle class and poor.
We must go beyond fine speeches if we're serious about protecting the needs of veterans. They've protected us. Now we must protect them.

The class of 2016 has an average debt of $37,172, the highest level of debt yet! In my view, we must make public colleges tuition free.
Social Security has been the most successful anti-poverty program in American history. That's why we must expand benefits, not cut them.
It makes no sense to degrade our environment in the interest of quick profits only to later spend billions to remedy the mess we've made.
If we want a vibrant democracy, where candidates have an even playing field, we need to move toward public funding of elections.
