I called you a putz cause I thought you werebeing intentionally disingenuous. If not I apologize. @CenLamar @dust92
Apologize for WHAT? @KRAUSEEE
Why was he FILMING his typical hijinks? Evidence? That's why he was let off. It proved he was innocent of MSNBC 'wiretap' charge. @CenLamar
What 'felony', genius? Getting senator's aides to admit she lied when not answering constituents calls claiming busted phones? @CenLamar
That's certainly not what the judge's ruling was, putz. @CenLamar
When Gawker exposed the GOP shirtless congressman who, too, resigned no lefties freaked out. Interesting double standard. @OccupyRebellion
Not true. It is certainly the Media Matters alternative reality the left keeps repeating. I get it. @KRAUSEEE
Yes, a misdemeanor. We get it. @CenLamar
Are Mark Rasch or Kevin Zeese your attorneys? If so, create a better working relationship with them. @Neal_Rauhauser
I compared @JamesOKeefeIII to Borat for the explicit purpose of explaining what his silly nothing misdemeanor was. @CenLamar @DavidShuster
You know this. All know this: It's called projection. But no one believes you believe it. Trolling is your livelihood. @Neal_Rauhauser
By 'ass on fire' I assume you mean that metaphorically. And if so, please elaborate. @Neal_Rauhauser
I think that it takes an undercover investigation to expose certain bad human behavior, indeed. You? @CenLamar
I think Borat got real politicians/personalities to act in real ways that we hold them to account for. O'Keefe is more serious. @CenLamar
I think you regret your post-Kos-Konvention enthusiasm. You went too far. Crossed too many lines. Now hope for a walk back. @Neal_Rauhauser
Tell it to the judge. @Neal_Rauhauser

Shame? I am exultant over Susan Sarandon's near half-century nude actressing experience. Quite frankly, who isn't? @teracorona
Which Sarandon naked scene is best, @teracorona? Lemon breast scene in Atlantic City or Holy-Moly-Sarandon&Deneuve-Lesbian-Vampiring?

Well, one is fictitious: Fletch. But based on what journalists do! Borat is a character like O'Keefe's pimp is a character. @mcsystemsgb
Leftists: It's OK for Borat & Fletch (Hi, Chevy Chase!) but not OK for @JamesOKeefeIII - EVER. For any reason!

You are an 'immoral, unethical, unprofessional' fraud - per your exMSNBC boss. You knew you were lying about O'Keefe 'felon'. @DavidShuster

You tweeted that ironically, @SimonMaloy? You folks at @MMFA are in no position to talk about 'obsessions'. Read this! http://t.co/at6DznL1

The Ghost of Christmas Past: How The Founder of Media Matters Betrayed The Founder of the @HuffingtonPost: http://t.co/at6DznL1 @MMFA
.@DavidShuster staked snarky 'fire your attorneys' on premise he would have found false w basic reporting. But the fired reporter failed.
It is clear: @DavidShuster is lying. Said I should 'fire my attorneys'. Why? Because he falsely claims we 'missed deadline.' Patently false.
You're not even in the ballpark. It's cute to watch you try if that's a consolation. @secretcabdriver
Love your posture in your avatar. @99Bristolman @DavidShuster
So @DavidShuster says not fired from MSNBC: Phil Griffin failed to retain 'not ethical, not moral & not professional' reporter over money?
I offered bet. It is based on this lie: 'Fire your lawyers for missing deadline.' I offered the bet. That is the lie.  @DavidShuster
'Fire your lawyers for missing deadline.' The @DavidShuster lie. The basis for bet.
Weren't these supposed to be the employed years when your ex-bosses didn't call you 'immoral, unethical & unprofessional', @DavidShuster?
Funny you know hinge your taunting on caveat that what Judge said may not be correct. Your taunt means nothing next to 'Judge said'.
You said we missed deadline. Mocked us. Now you figure out you overextended self. You ARE immoral, unethical, unprofessional. @DavidShuster
Shuster walks back specific Breitbart should 'fired his attys' taunt falsely implying they missed deadline. Liar. @FishbowlDC @DavidShuster
Shuster took the Media Matters media media course!. @brigge @DavidShuster
Wrong. @milowent @DavidShuster
No, you said I should fire my attys in an ill-thought out unprepared un-reporter-like flurry. And your premise is 100% false. @DavidShuster
I just RTed it. Liar. @DavidShuster
You stated mockingly that my lawyers missed a deadline and that I should fire them. Stop trying to change the bet. @DavidShuster @bpshow

What is the payout for said bet @DavidShuster? If I win what? If you win what?
We see the false ground you stand on. You claim bet was made. State it then: you accepted the bet? @DavidShuster
You're that dumb? Then take the bet. You continue to stand your false ground. Accept it. Then I can prove you wrong. Liar. @DavidShuster
Me, too. @KatiePavlich @Davidshuster
Admit it. You're nervous & confused. Like when you were forced by me to RETRACT LIVE ON MSNBC for lying about 'Wiretap Jr'! @DavidShuster
Admit it. You're nervous & confused. Like before you were fired from MSNBC for being 'unethical, immoral & unprofessional'! @DavidShuster
WRONG AGAIN. Take the bet, Dopey, the unethical, immoral, unprofessional (per MSNBC prez) wannabe Al Gore reporter. @DavidShuster

I suggest a lawless dystopia featuring anti-authoritarians, anti-police culture is prime territory for rape. And I'm right. @lizpelly
Nor did I fire her. Why did Obama fire her even AFTER Sherrod told him she 'helped white farmer'? It was all about #PIGFORD. @DavidWohl

3) Breitbart team is applying for leave to appeal his ruling. @KarlFrisch Why did you mindlessly pass off bad journalism? Just to hurt me?
2) Judge just supplied his reasoning for dismissing anti-SLAPP motion, after being asked to do so by the federal appeals court. @KarlFrisch
1) The judge already had denied the motion to dismiss, last July. He did so without explanation. @KarlFrisch
Oh, OK. I have no enemies on the Left. You take yourself too stupidly. @bobdobolina @KarlFrisch
Now that we've established Leftist #Occupy as Rape Safe Haven, let's move to show #OWS as anti-cop & pursuing 'violent conflict' w police.

You are a liar, @emilycrockett: It wasn't 'poor choice of words'; you chose for days not to correct MarkosKeithCenk 'poor choice of words.'
You explain away Cenk, Keith & Markos trio & their multiple days of pure #Occupy rape denialism as 'poor choice of words'? @emilycrockett
I didn't imply. I asked. You proved you'd let Keith & Cenk & Markos DENY #OWS rapes so you could be in with them. So gross. @emilycrockett

Hi. Have a nasty cold. In bed answering fan mail. @mattchew03
I savor that I am so under your skin. @cattyidiot
You didn't like I was winning. You played sour, then sweet. Sticks now carrots. You're very transparent. Freshman usually are. @RemyMMaisel
Wrong. I got 8 days of people talking about #OWS rapes. Was intentionally suppressed topic before. As in: I was CONSTRUCTIVE. @RemyMMaisel
Thanks. It's true. @ToniGoodman
Will The Left remove foot from its mouth? Or will there be a Day 9 of leftists denying/non-undenying denying about #Occupy Rapes?
'Southerners that were Ds in the 60s'... are either dead or very old. @HeeeeresSteven @DominicNanni @kniteowls
No, you haven't been respectful .You denied it and denied it until you could deny it no more. @RemyMMaisel
You think I'm the President of the United States? @RemyMMaisel
Oh, so you admit it. You were in wrong. Good. You did a stunt - like me w 'Stop Raping People!' re: #Occupy. Full circle! @RemyMMaisel
I'll admit your idiocy isn't on par w @EmilyCrockett's abetting Olbermann/Uygur rape denialism when she KNEW rapes happened. @RemyMMaisel
I don't care about your HuffPo writing. You aren't a person. You are an entity that attacked me. Then lectured me on civility. @RemyMMaisel
Your schtick is to keep laying on the thick moral high ground when ALL can see how this started. You were repeatedly rude. @RemyMMaisel
Yes, your writing - which is your flawed thinking - expressed is 'worthless'. You attacked me. Then lectured me on civility.  @RemyMMaisel
You didn't offend me. You still are backing away from your monumental hypocrisy. You're guilty of that which you accuse me of. @RemyMMaisel
Your method: Act innocent when there's trail to show you are guilty of what you accuse me of. This isn't high school any more. @RemyMMaisel
Apologize for entering my Twitter stream in a flurry of proactive rudeness - and then itonically lecturing me on etiquette. @RemyMMaisel
Don't bring up my family. You don't want to get on my bad side. @25thcenturygirl
You should market and sell the dumb chills you effortlessly induce as goose bumps from soaring moments. Maybe some will bite! @DominicNanni
But you did name call. And you did RT mean stuff said about me to hurt me. Now you're lecturing me on behavior you instigated! @RemyMMaisel
Let me be clear: I don't know you. You entered my world & you entered it rudely. Spare me the fake civility lesson. @RemyMMaisel
You're attacking me. You're RTing H8 hurled at me. I'm responding. I respond to Leftist H8. Everyone gets that. Don't they? @RemyMMaisel
G'night parasite.@DominicNanni
A gal gets herself into a corner & now feels need to save face & wants to write a worthless untimely article. Please. @RemyMMaisel
You're boring me to tears. Spare me. You have your dogma. I have mine. You'll never win me to enthusiastic freshman Marx 101. @DominicNanni
Dude. I didn't publish it. Are you really that dense? @RemyMMaisel
Well, please write HuffPo piece attacking Gawker. They published & everybody yawned. It's all a ruse to attack me. @RemyMMaisel
Funneling the money to the top? I call 'funneling' EARNING IT. Parasite. Guilt tripper. Ingrate. @DominicNanni
You are ascribing your morality on me. How 'Christianist' of you. Does HuffPo know you roll that way? @RemyMMaisel
Why? HE sent those to strangers. Why is showing a congressman's pics he sent many women not newsworthy? It is. @RemyMMaisel
Well, it is unethical for you to put false motives on me. If I wanted it out, I would have gotten it out - CLEANLY. Duh. @RemyMMaisel
So trying to render showing newsworthy pics to people - something I never claimed I wouldn't do - unethical is sophistry. @RemyMMaisel
Let me repeat: There was nothing unethical about Gawker publishing those newsworthy pics. Nada. I just made decision not to. @RemyMMaisel
They create more ways to extract monies from productive citizens to give to less productive ones & class war ad infinitum. @DominicNanni
I claimed I wouldn't publish it. I didn't. You are trying to make something out of nothing. @RemyMMaisel
Until you go by your real name, I'm done with you. Parasite. @DominicNanni
And you? You're an anonymous cowardly parasite. @DominicNanni
I agree with Grover. Especially as relates to #Occupy. Parasites indeed. Deal with it. Remember: Dissent is Patriotic. @DominicNanni
Gawker PUBLISHED the photo. I didn't. If it is UNETHICAL - show me 1 place that attacked Gawker for publishing it. One. @RemyMMaisel
Ready? @RemyMMaisel
I'm gonna prove how disingenuous this line of attack is. @RemyMMaisel
Because I didn't want to publish what were newsworthy photos. Perios. I had a right to. I chose not to. @RemyMMaisel
The freaks & animals go beyond the rapists. It goes to those who would twinkles down REPORTING the rapes. Sick #OWS culture. @DominicNanni
Never said it was unethical to publish it. It isn't. It's newsworthy. I just chose not to. And coulda made killing publishing. @RemyMMaisel
A personal conversation where I changed my mind is not unethical. I CHANGED MY MIND. And regret it because what they did w it. @RemyMMaisel
Dodging 'freaks and animals' question?! Are you nuts? #Occupy is filled with freaks and animals. Damn! You got me again! @DominicNanni
You are unethically LYING. I NEVER said I wouldn't SHOW it. Said I'd never PUBLISH. Huge difference. @RemyMMaisel
That pic is definition of newsworthy. Never said I'd never show it - something he can't claim either. Said wouldn't PUBLISH. @RemyMMaisel
Why? Gawker posted pic. I didn't. NO ONE got pissed at Gawker. That pic was evidence. I had RIGHT to publish. Chose not to. @RemyMMaisel
And what did I do unethically regarding Weiner? Why did he have to apologize to me and not other way around? @RemyMMaisel
And, DEAR, you RTed hateful things said about me! To hurt me. Yet I shouldn't?! @RemyMMaisel @OkieMuskogee33
She is not Rape Denier. I am clear: Cenk & Olbermann denied #OWS rapes all week - yet she aided & abetted them for her 15mins. @RemyMMaisel
No, dear. You're listening very closely. You've heard me loud & clear & are pissed I won - again. Theatrically. @RemyMMaisel
Because after being EXPOSED as liar, opportunist she doubled down w more lies in another Campus Progress story. Good grief. @RemyMMaisel
So you give the reporter who enabled the rape deniers a pass but criticize the means by which I exposed the charade? Uh. OK. @RemyMMaisel
Yes. Duh. @GrantBrooke
She's filed multiple stories with multiple false accusations against me with sole purpose to hurt me. I fight back. Get it? @RemyMMaisel
You don't find repugnant she NOW admits knowing #Occupy rapes occurred as Keith & Cenk used her silence to claim they didn't. @RemyMMaisel
Not remotely. I did NOTHING WRONG. Been reporting to deaf ears the #Occupy crime spree, rapes. Finally people are noticing. @RemyMMaisel
She was used by @KeithOlbermann & @CenkUygur much, dope. She used this as entrance into the big time & sold her soul. @GrantBrooke
That would be 'your', creepy lookin' dude. @johntheplumbr
To expose that the central media-pushed premise of progressivism/The Left - tolerance - is a manufactured & provable fallacy. @RemyMMaisel
How effin' patronizing? Is it because she's a female reporter that you diminish her? Or her age (28 ain't a kiddie)? @GrantBrooke
She spent a week lying about me, covering up #Occupy rapes that she now admits happened. And you blame me?! I exposed this. @RemyMMaisel
Versus you attacking me, a complete stranger who doesn't know me from Adam? That's HELPFUL?!@ RemyMMaisel
I sure as hell get a free pass for being white. Nobody bothers me. It's like I'm a protected class! @Ronc99 @25thcenturygirl @DkChoco

.@emilycrockett was nobody until Keith & Cenk - rape deniers for most of  week - used her. She stayed silent aiding that evil. @brfreed

Read your article again, @emilycrockett. You so wanted to 'score political points' you chose to aid progressives you knew were lying.
Would you hold down an #Occupy rape victim being raped to further your career, too? You've come a long way, baby. @EmilyCrockett?
Explain how I'm wrong: 1) REPORTER @EmilyCrockett NOW claims #OWS rapes happened; 2) Yet spent week aiding #OWS rape deniers Keith & Cenk.
Racist. @Thepeteypo @emilycrockett
What @emilyCrockett has written about me is beyond over top. Lies built on lies. She made mistake of palling w RAPE DENIERS. @AmyAlex63
You on other hand spent week working w equivalent of Bernard Law to cover up Church (#Occupy) rapes. Sick. Sick. Sick @emilycrockett
You're really so unbelievably sick. No one DENIED church, military rapes. They are RIGHTFULLY reported, taken seriously. @emilycrockett
You spent week selling out women by aiding @KeithOlbermann to deny rapes you knew happened - all to help your career. Sick. @emilycrockett
Please elucidate for audience how you come to conclusion I don't care about women being raped, @EmilyCrockett? You are a filthy animal.
Now that you got caught palling around w Rape Denialists, @emilycrockett, you transfer blame to person who told truth. SCURRILOUS. WENCH.
What type of scurrilous wench kisses @KeithOlbermann's #OccupyRapeDenying misogynist ass knowing well #OWS rapes happened? @emilycrockett
And you LIED about me being drunk, Ms. Reporter. And you lied about me breaking glass, Ms. Reporter. You scurrilous wench! @emilycrockett
We EXPOSE Team Gore (Cenk y Keith) as #Occupy rape deniers & you claim I don't care about RAPE?! I have daughter & wife, scurrilous wench!

My Twitter warring began w my reax to death of Ted Kennedy. His life & lifestyle repulsed me. His leftist politics granted him immunity.
Only a respected NYTimes journo could posit Mary Jo Kopechne may have appreciated her death due to Ted Kennedy's leftist political succeses.
Greatest rationale to become Leftie is immunity from rules they impose on rest of us. The sanctioning of the double standard & hypocrisy.

Debunked? Is that newly defined as me getting both @CenkUygur (pronounced 'Steve') & @KeithOlbermann to admit #Occupy rapes? @ragweedjones
Either actively or willfully ignorant. Yes. Liberals, less so. @aflunky
What's that?! Never heard of it. @lcjs
Inconvenient Truth II: Filthy #Occupy Rapists Boogaloo - True Story of Anthropogenic #Occupy Raping Deniers @CenkUygur & @KeithOlbermann!
Time for CurrentTV bigwig Al Gore's masseuse to be final word on whether @KeithOlbermann & @CenkUygur crossed #OCCUPY RAPE DENIAL line.
IF you were so comfortable w that absurdly 100% exculpatory explanation, why does #Occupy coordinate rape reporting suppression? @sqeptiq
"FeministWire' - that known right wing Internet salon! @Andrew_Dad @TrulyFreeWorld
Just as Cenk (pronounced 'Steve') did! @Andrew_Dad @TrulyFreeWorld
Any liberal feminists getting Juanita Brodderick creepy feeling that their political allies willing to condone rape in pursuit of The Cause?
Thanks! But I'm 'craaaaazy'. So crazy we changed the narrative. Exposed #Occupy dark heart & media's naturally evil complicity. @CobaltZann
Keith says Breitbart exploiting rape victims to smear #Occupy: http://t.co/fazYQgAm Nice pivot! What #OWS rape victims, @KeithOlbermann?!
I think problem is ace Cornell Agricultural student @KeithOlbermann is applying barnyard sexual standards to the #Occupy rapists.
IS that Stockholm Rape Syndrome? KO DENIES rapes occurred & you defend him though you were sexually assaulted?! No comment. @TrulyFreeWorld

What was your genius idea to get the left and #Occupy on the defense over #Occupy rapes and rape suppression? @SkipTerrio
Dissent is patriotic, unless, of course, you disagree w a leftist. Post-structuralism is anti-liberal, anti-academic. Deal. @DominicNanni
Yes, he lied. Very, very much so. @DaMayor73
Same shameless MSM propagandists behind #Occupy rape & crime suppression were behind fake disproved Tea Party N-word campaign. @tommyxtopher
Talk about projection: #Occupy rape suppression is because they want rape victims to be quiet - rendering them #Occupy pawns. @DaMayor73
Remember Juanita Brodderick? Left in total denial over Clinton rape allegation. I repeat: It takes a few broken vulvas to make an omelette.
Solution for Rape-Friendly & Rape-Suppressing #Occupy: Al Gore-Rape-Offsets for #Occupy Rapists! @KeithOlbermann @TheYoungTurks
We got Current TV's Cenk Uygur to reverse his #Occupy rape denialism. Now we need Al Gore to step up to force @KeithObermann to come clean.
Why hasn't Al Gore stepped in to protect the women? As long as @KeithOlbermann is covering up #OccupyRapes he is aiding #Occupy rapists.
Yes, be VERY careful @tdominic @KeithOlbermann

Why are so many lefties denying the ludicrous amounts of #Occupy rapes in very short period of time? @ToniGoodman @CenkUygur @KeithOlbermann
#Occupy rapes happened. Cenk denied then on show changed course; admitted to rapes. @KeithOlbermann double denied. @Crabb90 @TheYoungTurks
Correct it or experience wrath felt by race arsonist, man who fears black pilots @timjacobwise & @EricBoehlert.  @TheYoungTurks
Cenk's first quote of me is EXACTLY OPPOSITE of what I said. How shockingly evil in light of message I 'selectively edit'. @TheYoungTurks

#Occupy rapes, filth, drum circles part of Caucasian pathetic leftist Gaia fetish toward Paganism & primitivism. Black #Occupiers flummoxed.
Those who've been raped at #Occupy should've shouted in blood curdling horror at movement's will  to suppress, protect evil. That's just me.
I ask aloud at #Occupy: Capitalism - Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down. It's always thumbs down w Commies, Socialists everywhere. @JillianBlazek

Look at the timeline, moron. He called the press conference an hour before it occurred. What say you? @DrTesla33
OK. Be skeptical. I was called up by the press. It was on tape. Also, was defending self against his LIES. Next question. @DrTesla33
Yes, there WAS a YOUNG & DEAF boy raped at Zucotti #OWS - per an #OWS official tour guide. http://t.co/ETMxfr5P @JasonBCorbin
Put you money where your filthy mouth is: bet me on existence of #OccupyRapes. As in plural. $100k? Ready... go... @JasonBCorbin
$100K to #OWS advocate who can disprove #OccupyRapes. They happened. They were/are suppressed. And, yes, that makes you filthy animals.
They trespassed. They tried to shout down & shut down people exercising their First Amendment rights. Which side are you on?! @Corpulace
I was thinking that Occupy horde is a bunch of programmed, lawless dirty vulgarians trying to shut up civil discouse at CPAC. @VinBioDiesel
How? Occupy in threatening chants & presence trespassed on private property forcing CPAC shut-down. I took on the vulgarians. @SlimBender
And the #Occupy idiot leadership tells the raped NOT to report them. Would hurt #Occupy image. Animals. Animals. @doubled2520

Meet each other & compare notes on lying & race arson: @bryanthemusical & @timjacobwise Sickos.
I was @bryanthemusical. But my politics in his addled, PC mind means I'm 'racist' so he did what @TimJacobWise did & lied thru his teeth.
Recall @bryanthemusical, fmr classmate used anon blog to LIE I hung out w druggies, bullied in HS - then I outed him. http://t.co/lYEMotp7

Was weird all around. I was naive on race being from sequestered LA. So I saw there was/is REAL racism. Never denied it since. @mcsystemsgb
If I had to guess of two, my supposition was it wasn't because of the fight/Jewish thing. Likely black rushee. Just saying. @mcsystemsgb
Was very weird. Because local media had driven home black frat rushee angle. There was no closure. But likely 1 or other. @mcsystemsgb
Actually, there was parallel incident where I got into fight w dude who called me 'f*g'. Cops suspected was retaliation. @mcsystemsgb
Infrastructure of @MSNBC - down to @MMFA supporting 'historian' Beschloss, @TheRevAl, @Toure, @TimJacobWise - is to accuse GOP of racism.
They didn't find perp. But there was 2nd theory by Tulane PD: I was cause of cross burning because I'm Jewish. @mcsystemsgb

To show how disingenuous you are - you said youd 'eviscerate' me by ALL means - why didnt bring up my 'culpability' til NOW? @timjacobwise
Yeah & Clinton wouldn't answer to it. I will. Publicly. With accountability. He can't. Won't. It's an evil lie. @Beckisnuts77 @timjacobwise
Debate me on the Tulane Cross Burning at Tulane's McAlister Auditorium. A Mock Trial. And I'll mop floor w your lying ass. @timjacobwise
Either theory: I was object/victim of cross burning. & your sick world view makes you make up lies. Debate me publicly on it. @timjacobwise
The police said they were not convinced it was related to the black rushee. But was perhaps aimed at me because I am Jewish. @timjacobwise
I WAS object of cross-burning, you freak. I had SPONSORED a black rushee for DTD membership. I SPOKE to Tulane PD. @timjacobwise

Just nasty. Anti-free speech. I support Maher and Loesch. @AmyTheNewAgenda @SarahPalinUSA @DLoesch
Show me one thing @DLoesch said on CNN that is unprofessional - beyond, say liberal hotheads Begala or Carville? @AmyTheNewAgenda
This is @SarahPalinUSA, @MichelleBachmann issue too. Liberal NE gals can't stand unapologetic conservative WOMEN. @AmyTheNewAgenda @DLoesch
Your liberal pal @BillMaher defended Marines. There goes your coordinated attempt to take @DLoesch down. Wah wah wah wah. @AmyTheNewAgenda
'Screechy' @EricBoehlert is 'Soros creation'. Even I admit what I typed about you was misogynist attack on you.

Shock: Frequent CNN commentator & @MMFA 'Senior Fellow' Caught in Middle of Misogynist Rant Against Award-Winning @DLoesch. Developing...
Never took YOU on. Pointed out Mediaite - vis-a-vis your post - shows  major standing down on @DLoesch case. Per BillMaher. @tommyxtopher
I am playing honest role of defending @DLoesch from what is clearly  orchestrated @MMFA-led attack to destroy her in MSM. @tommyxtopher
You're trying to invent something. It's incoherent. @tommyxtopher
My RT of a factual @MissADelgado tweet misinterpreted by you is not deserving of me doing anything. @tommyxtopher
Falsehood: I didn't tweet that. Correction: I RTed @MissADelgado. Falsehood: She cited @Mediaite, not you. Correct that, too. @tommyxtopher
Was asked whether Hitler was LW or RW - as Left continues to wrongly argue he's RW. Used his party's name to push back on fallacy. @macklinh
When RW Houston DJs used post-9/11 sentiment to silence @BillMaher RW saw as threat to media free speech. Why can't MSM act same w @DLoesch?
You're a 'cat herder dog lover bird'? Weird. What do you look like? @lehimesa @pandagon
Far left needs to brand me 'extremist' or 'far right' - yet can't name 1 policy position that makes me far right. @macklinh @Lizardoid
What false tweet about your story? @tommyxtopher
You do see strategy here, right, @tommyxtopher? @MMFA wants all aggressive 'Breitbart bloggers' removed, isolated from MSM discussion.
Many conservatives (Prager, Rush, Medved, Hannity, me) DEFENDED @BillMaher after 9/11 over similar take-off-air campaign, @tommyxtopher.
Don't you see @MMFA taking great offense ruse when @BillMaher, @AllenWest, @BritHumeFOX, @GovernorPerry conveyed same idea, @tommyxtopher?
Don't you find it troubling Loesch family stalker Adam Shriver working w  @MMFA to try to destroy @DLoesch, @tommyxtopher?
Don't you find this predictable selective target anti-free speech silencing campaign the least bit troubling, @tommyxtopher?

This isn't about disagreeing w @DLoesch. This is about @mmfa's well-financed Stalinist enterprise to silence critics in mainstream media.
I waged campaign in 2001 to defend leftie @billmaher from Houston righties trying to kick him off ABC. Its same FS issue. @goldietaylor
She said it in passing on her St Louis show. Leftists trying to weaponize into anti-free speech kick her off CNN weapon. @goldietaylor
How many Xs must you register your disagreement w/out her fighting until you're sated? This is @Mmfa. Period. @goldietaylor @mmfa @dloesch
This isn't about disagreeing w her. This is about participating in @mmfa's campign to kick her off CNN. @goldietaylor @dloesch @billmaher
Yes, Left's pathway to victory is to take out @dloesch via @mmfa anti-free speech discipline. Ignore @billmaher. Discipline. @goldietaylor
This is about a surgical propaganda play to attack military as representative & attack their defenders. And avoid CIC Obama. @goldietaylor
You're setting up false premise of higher moral rectitude. This isn't about that. Its about left exploiting it. Per usual. @goldietaylor
America's Pledge to Taliban: We'll stop military corpse pissins & tone down on Gay Pride Parade sparklers & chaps! Now will you like us?
I believe in @LizzieWurtzel exceptionalism wherein you're not representative of modern liberal sentiment. Cause leftism poisoned liberalism.
Why is what @EricBoehlert does electivelt on Wednesday nights w 'imaginary Verizon guys' so deplorable when done by military? @MMFA
Its lie. I have not excused it. Said shouldn't be military policy. Against leftist anti-military propaganda exploitation campaign. @clmerle
Keep reveling in it. Keep exploiting it. Ignore that Leftie fave @billmaher taking similar position as @dloesch. Hypocrite. @christiemount
Who said I'm against investigating the isolated incident. Said shouldn't be our military policy. Idiot.  @monkeycita
Yes. I do. I think Middle East mindset not unlike American Left mindset. You are enthralled. So are they. @Zoocritter
Given choice between 5 star meal (1%!) or bemoaning America & her military, what would a Leftist rather do on his/her death bed?

Overheard at @MMFA hqtrs: While it's unfortunate our nihilist cheerleader @BillMaher agreed w @DLoesch, let's just ignore it. @EricBoehlert
Yeah, that's why ABC & CNN both determines to stop playing it - as to NOT foment emotionalism. Unlike on this one. @MSMCGirl @Zoocritter
So desperate for win, you lie, distort what I say. Point where I said disagreeing w actions of Marines 'anti-American'? @logicalisis
Who's Leftist surgeon responsible for un-Abu-Ghraibing Taliban Pee Pics  miraculously extricating CIC Obama from responsibility? Kudos!
What lie? Seriously, what lie? Left clearly propagandizing the Taliban Pee Pic incident for political reasons. Duh. @sandyknauer
You're lathering in anti-American self-hatred over incident. Trying to turn 1 day story into totem of military. It's obvious. @Zoocritter
I'm saying playing it over & over & over for purposes of anti-American propaganda is uncouth & overkill. @Zoocritter
Stop exploiting Taliban pee pic incident! Even with leftist president, activist Left can't help self trying to peg military as backwards.
Just like Rodney King - cops hate blacks! narrative - Left only happy to propagandize to foment ill will. Re: Taliban pee pics. @Zoocritter
Left demanded NO replaying of 9/11 planes into buildings footage. But wants to replay world (w instructions!) Taliban pee pics. @Zoocritter

But are you saying Scott Baker is doing #OWS undercover work, the kind of @JamesOKeefeIII work Beck/O'Keefe have blasted? @salty_hollywood
Do tell. I know Scott Baker behind campaign to ruin @JamesOKeefeIII 4 Beck to neutralize false perception I AM O'KEEFE. @salty_hollywood

Must be disciplined. Follow new rules, Andrew. Refer to bio if you have to. OK. Ready, begin.
New policy going up in my bio. Will only RT or spar w those Tweeting in own names. This #Anonymous crap getting old. Blocking Anons, too.
@GhostofBonzo Shamed anonymous cowardly freak! Own your bilge! Show some courage! Part II.
Another Twitter deflection. Pathetic. @zombiebroder
@GhostofBonzo Shamed anonymous cowardly freak! Own your bilge! Show some courage!
Name 2 person on Twitter who posts Social Security number! Your answer showed you know you're a coward & had to deflect. @purebullshit
Let's marginalize Twitter's #Anonymous Trolls. Call the cowards out - left & right. Post in your name or be treated with contempt.

Wonder how many believe that or ACORN wasn't/isn't involved in Chicago styled manufactured votes, + Left suppressing military vote. @K_JOE_
In 08 Hope & Change was high point in Left's aspirations. People showed  faces, mostly acted in name. Now it's #Anonymous, cloaked & shamed.
What's it like knowing left's Election12 strategy dependent on #Anonymous trolls, #Occupiers, Hacktivists creating mischief, @EricBoehlert?
All these anonymous Leftists on Twitter, Comment Sections & #Occupy. No wonder they embrace cowardly #Anonymous Guy Fawkes as mascot!
Who says? @zombiebroder
I used the very specific term 'dickhead' to describe @EricBoehlert because he is a dickhead. Truth is unassailable. @zombiebroder
Hugh Hewitt used to have comment section. But Election08 hacktivist left flooded zone to destroy community. @MMFA rinsing, repeating in 12.
Left's Election12: @TheRevAl, @Toure, @Maddow, Bashir play RaceCard 24/7. @MMFA provides script. Hacktivists scheme online. #Occupy off.
Demented sicko. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick political necrophiliac! Sick sick  superfreaky sicko! @EricBoehlert
On 1yr anni of Giffords horror, reminder evil opportunist @EricBoehlert led charge to play politics & pin right for act of a psychotic.
Clearly, you do. @Idoni
You can't beat me fair and square so you just make it up. So desperate. And all can see. @EricBoehlert
Go look your kids in the eye and tell them you are a devious, lying, ends-justify-means bastard. Cause that's what you are. @EricBoehlert
Do you condemn your pals Twitter trolling, Internet comment infiltration & Swatting techniques? @EricBoehlert
We'll pursue this, as also relates to domestic terrorist, perjurer Speedway Bomber Brett Kimberlin's Rauhauser Chaos Team. @EricBoehlert
Focusing on our comment system AT EXACT MOMENT we're under coordinated attack. Very interesting, @EricBoehlert. We knew you were desperate.
Keep it going, dickhead. We're inundated w fakes mimicking real commenters. Coordinated. Classic Kimberlin, Rauhauser, left. @EricBoehlert
@BillyJackSmacks As in I report such harsh politically incorrect truths about corrupt political class it's best described as 'violent'.
Yeah,you're looking real good. Life's done you wonders. @johntheplumbr
Is tonight's surprise SNL band Mike and the Mechanics?
Graduating HS. @johntheplumbr
Kudos for snagging Charles Barkley for SNL, Lorne. I was feeling nostalgic for 1987, too!
I hear Dem policies have done wonder for Detroit's economy. And those auto unions! So conscientious of how business works! @DominicNanni
You do kick ass. Amazing stuff. @DominicNanni
I went to the Tulane University of Love. Where did you go? Where did Martin Bashir go? Where did Dorothy Hamil go? @DominicNanni
Yeah, that is the best I can do. You are so smart. You are so dominant. @DominicNanni
Does your name mean 'Year of the Nanny' in Latin because it sure seems apt for your worldview. @DominicNanni
Pathetic. @Matifesto
You're not even trying. You're just typing in terms randomly you know loosely relate to the subject matter. @toddlap @RangerSG
Where are you coming up with these faux-philosophical no-truths? @toddlap
Death penalty. Not 'war'. You know better than I do that's what we are debating. You change subject cause you're losing. @toddlap
Sinful heart? Sinful heart? It's not thoughts, or aspirations, or weaknesses being condemned. It's willful human actions. @toddlap
If you can't distinguish between innocent lives & cold-blooded murderers, that's your problem, not mine. @toddlap
Told you I could care less if you think my pro-death penalty negates YOUR interpretation of 'pro-life'. Call me anti-abortion. @toddlap
Disagree with @RonPaul - you get excommunicated. The perils of independent thinking! @patriotsnetwork @PatDollard
At least Peter Singer makes sense when he defends evil. @toddlap
You're all over map, dude. Citing Jesus to make your point? Ripping people who believe the bible. I stand by my assessment: Freak! @toddlap
To call that an oversimplification would be an oversimplification. She was a Eugenicist. Death penalty has nothing to do w that. @toddlap
This Drew Brees is good, but he ain't no Bobby Hebert! @derekahunter
Y, it's perplexing ethical position: believing in sanctity of innocent life & not those who use free will to snuff out innocents. @toddlap
Well, if believing in killing calculated cold-hearted murderers isn't pro-life then just call me anti-abortion Andy! @toddlap
Do the crime, do the... sizzle, zap, snurldle, gasp, thud. @toddlap
Let's work on that project! Let's find a deserving rich white cold-blooded murderer & push for state to off him. Fun! @toddlap
I like my RT strategy just fine. And you leftist freaks keep attacking me. @Theresthatbear
I'll see your manufactured cartoon controversy, @MMFA, & raise you @FShakir email admitting CAP 'Anti-Semitism': http://t.co/cwU5yzRD
You think I don't engage against my critics on my own? Funny.  @Theresthatbear
To quote my leftist neighbors: 'Slippery slope! Slippery slope!' @LGordonPoker
I didn't call in anyone. How childish to make up a provable lie. @Theresthatbear @WayneASchneider
For lib-media-bias-denying-lib media, they sure show dramatic defiant front when grilling conservatives on basic conservative stances.
Truth-mongering. @alexanderrocks
Just sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. http://t.co/YTeajjOE @alexanderrocks
No, I was just not exposed in college, high school to conservative world view. Once I lived in real world, it became obvious. @toddlap
Mr Obama, what would you say to your daughters about your vote where born, alive babies from botched abortions can STILL be killed?
That macabre MSM grilling of GOP w over-top shmaltzy & personalized Qs can go both ways. Would love to use that technique w Dems & abortion!
Hi! @keachhagey
Excuse me, there is only ONE Jazzy! ----&gt; @Lizardoid @toddlap @RBJazzy
For how many years, debates have media given Clintons, Obamas, black & Hispanic Dems massive pass on anti-gay marriage stance?
Don't sweat it, Georgie!
ABC NEWS Presents: CSI Conservatives: This isn't a debate. It's 'objective,' 'neutral' MSM journalists rudely probing a foreign species.
No, you lie. @toddlap
There you go again. I would never assert there are no racists in Alabama. @toddlap
'Racist' is the bottom of the barrel of ad hominems, pal. Throw in your grotesque stereotyping and you're a worthless beast. @toddlap
Robert Byrd's existence in Dem Party was testament to progressive, populist roots of KKK. Not to any 'redemption'. @toddlap
Whatever ignorance you ascribe to bible-believers you exhibit in spades relating to your hideous progressive non-racist rehistory. @toddlap
Hey #Alabama! Are ya'll all racist? @toddlap says so!
You bring up the bible now. Nice. @toddlap
I don't think most/all are 'racist f#$%heads'. I think most Dems are sickly programmed in Marxist multicultural PC illogic. @toddlap
With cosmically simpleminded theory that all/most southern conservatives are 'racist' I pray you don't operate a moving vehicle. @toddlap
I lived in Louisiana. Texas? Did you? @toddlap
Wow! No, I am not. I am defending against your all-encompassing hyper-stupid thesis of GOP, southerners being racist. @toddlap
I like conservative southerners. What type of freak show MSNBC watching shut-in makes you think they are racist? @toddlap
You didn't hit a sacred cow. You are singing the left's most oversung scared cow cliche. It's intellectually pathetic. @toddlap
Of course he would. He wanted govt money. He wanted to stick it to the poor. Could you be less informed? @toddlap @wayneaschneider
Coughlin, too. At core of progressivism is class warfare. Oppressor/oppressed cultural leftism is race-based. @toddlap @wayneaschneider
Do you not see how fallible, foolish your simpleminded theory is? You keep crafting excuses for flaws in your conspiracy. @toddlap
So what Senator in the Republican South is/was racist while Dem Robert Byrd was? @toddlap @jaredmares68 @ericboehlert
'Reverse racism' is basic RE-assertion - countering stupid leftist dogma - that non-whites can't be racist. Basic logic. @purebullshit
Conservatives have been put on defensive by the Dem/Left Race Industry. It's High Time we finally fight back.
'I don't think Father Coughlin was a progressive' is startling ignorant statement. It's exactly what he was - to his core! @WayneASchneider
Do I [& right, GOP, conservatives] ever not get attacked by well-funded left on race charge is better question? I fight back! @purebullshit
Sanger & Coughlin are PROGRESSIVES 1st & foremost. Own it. Robert Byrd, too. David Duke is hardcore statist. @toddlap @ceolas @ericboehlert
Or how about that great 'progressive' race champion, Father Coughlin? Could you be more dumb? Useless? @toddlap @WayneASchneider
Good 'progressives' like anti-black eugenics based Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger? @toddlap @WayneASchneider
In many countries people spend days making, selling things. But in liberal America citizens call fellow citizens racist! The new prosperity!
Didn't you see The Suite Life w Al Gore episode when his Dem Senator dad came home w No vote on 1964 Civil Rights Act? @WayneASchneider
That sounds like something straight out of the KKK 1936 brochure! Congrats! @WayneASchneider
At the core of KKK politics is class warfare. Which party, ideoplogy is screaming that angry populist tune today? @WayneASchneider #OWS
You asked for it, dope. @toddlap @ericboehlert
Yes, Al Sharpton represents most liberals. He is weapon for all liberals. And capital of liberalism MSNBC deploys it. @WayneASchneider
Your entire RacistRacist worldview is flawed. It's why you have  shadow haunting you in your avatar. @WayneASchneider @ericboehlert @mmfa
Your idea of racism is conservatives guilt until proven innocent but don't give them a trial. @WayneASchneider @ericboehlert @mmfa
Well, name any top conservatives high up in food chain like Reid & Biden who've said anything that racist? @WayneASchneider @ericboehlert
Are Harry 'Negro Dialect' Reid & Joe 'Articulate and Clean African American' Biden racist? @WayneASchneider @ericboehlert @ceolas @mmfa
Gee, some leftist in the past said conservatives are stupid. Amazing. @WayneASchneider @JohnFreeland1 @adamsbaldwin @TheUSAsFuture
Media Matters still hiring? @WayneASchneider makes the positively @ericboehlert case that 'most' conservatives are racist! @ceolas @mmfa
Hi, Angelo Carusone of Media Matters! What'd you think of the anti-Semitism at CAP? http://t.co/OAefqyAg @StopBeck @mmfa
Yikes. Games rolling your way in first 10 mins. @derekahunter
I just gave you 7! The Saints defense doesn't appear to have arrived. @derekahunter
The @AndrewBreitbart Twitter staff of 17 joyous twentysomethings wishes you a belated happy new year! That includes @EricBoehlert!
As you call me a few choice names. Hypocrite. But you still have a fantastic shadow in your avatar! @WayneASchneider
Belgium City is correct! @danielbreid
So anechdotal. @geoff9cow
I like this tandem human-computer Twitter answer contraption! What's the capital of Belgium?
Thanks. I thought 8pm. Hopefully Saints well in control so I can tune in. @Robert23Hersey
What channel's the debate on?
Where's @MMFA's outrage over liberal @Gawker's liberal writer Seth Abramovitch using N-Word, @EricBoehlert? http://t.co/pZ2F6yXD
Clever. As clever as your Twitter name. Life in the upper echelon, the cerebral 1%. Must be nice. @yuppieskum @MMFA @Lizardoid
Is this why @EricBoehlert & Seven @MMFA dwarfs were harassing me for 14 days over that cartoon?  http://t.co/OAefqyAg [That was rhetorical.]
Email Proves 'Anti-Semitism' at Lib Think Tank: Will Faiz Shakir fire Zaid Jilani over 'Israel Firster' slur at CAP? http://t.co/OAefqyAg
You're long overdue for one of your I'm-just-one-of-the-guys sports tweets, @EricBoehlert!
Oe @Toure Von Getoffhissblackberry.
Or @Toure Drummond.
Late entry! @Toure Palooza!
Tune in as I will be NotReallButJustBarelyWatching&Tweeting The #NHdebate tonight! [Geaux Saints!]
